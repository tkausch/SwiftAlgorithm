# Swift Algorithms

This repository contains playgrounds with implementaions for common swift problems,  code puzzles and other algorithms.

The focus is on clarity and simplicity of code. That said, most of the code should be ready for your project. Or use the code to prepare for you programming interview or computer science studies. 

## Swift Standard Library Missing Algorithms

[Swift Algorithms](https://swift.org/blog/swift-algorithms/) is an open-source package of sequence and collection algorithms, along with their related types. It's pretty new and development is ongoing. This section contains some missing parts.

## Swift Knowledge Base

This is a swift knowledge base for common ios problems that occure during daily developer work. The knowledge  base is grouped into categories and provides playgrounds for the listed problems.

## Swift Puzzles

Swift Code puzzles is a collection of interesting problems (also known as challenges) that will help Swift you to learn and practice your skills in logic programming, data structures and algorithms in the Swift programming language.


### Strings
* [Longest Palindrom Substring](puzzles/LongestPalindromSubstring.playground/Contents.swift): Two simple solutions to a simple but interesting problem.
* [Palindromr](puzzles/Palindrome.playground/Contents.swift): Check if a given string is a palindrome.
* [Longest Palindrom Substring](puzzles/LongestPalindromSubstring.playground/Contents.swift): Looks for longest palincromic stubstring.
* [Palindrome Number](puzzles/PalindromNumber.playground/Contents.swift): Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.

* [Plus One](puzzles/PlusOne.playground/Contents.swift): Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.
* [Sum](puzzles/Sum.playground/Contents.swift):  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
* [WordLadder](puzzles/WordLadder.playground/Contents.swift):  Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord.
* [Roman Numbers](puzzles/RomanIntegers.playground/Contents.swift): Given a integer convert to roman repreentation and vice versa. 
* [Missing Ranges](puzzles/MissingRanges.playground/Contents.swift): Given a sorted integer array return its missing ranges.

* [MaxSubArraySumProblem](https://gist.github.com/tkausch/17bba0364fc5949138139b1ef6214a3e): Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
* [MaySubArrayProductProblem](https://gist.github.com/tkausch/e263c9cbda4a7652df2543e36a84df32) [Smarter](https://gist.github.com/tkausch/d241c688feb952112423acdc8590273f) Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

### Cryptography
* [Alphabet Cipher](puzzles/AlphabetCipher.playground/Contents.swift): Implement an Alphabet Cipher in Swift. 



### Foundations

* [Big-O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) If you don't understand what does **O(n)** mean you should read this first.
* [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) Recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. Many problems have simple recursive solutions. 

### Data Structures
* [Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree](BasicAlgorithms/BinaryTree.playground/Contents.swift): A tree where each node has at most two children.
