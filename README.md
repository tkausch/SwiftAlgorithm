# Swift Algorithms

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and beyond. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

This repository contains playgrounds with implementaions for common swift problems,  code puzzles and fundamential algorithms.

The focus is on clarity and simplicity of code. That said, most of the code should be ready for your project. Or use the code to prepare for you programming interview or computer science studies. 

Code ist compatible with **XCode 11.5 and Swift 5.2**.


## Swift Knowledge Base

This is a swift knowledge base for common ios problems that occure during daily developer work. The knowledge  base is grouped into categories and provides playgrounds for the listed problems.

### Collections


## Swift Puzzles

Swift Code puzzles is a collection of interesting problems (also known as challenges) that will help Swift you to learn and practice your skills in logic programming, data structures and algorithms in the Swift programming language.


### Strings
* [Longest Palindrom Substring](CodePuzzles/LongestPalindromSubstring.playground/Contents.swift): Two simple solutions to a simple but interesting problem.
* [Palindromr](CodePuzzles/Palindrome.playground/Contents.swift): Check if a given string is a palindrome.
* [Longest Palindrom Substring](CodePuzzles/LongestPalindromSubstring.playground/Contents.swift): Looks for longest palincromic stubstring.
* [Palindrome Number](CodePuzzles/PalindromNumber.playground/Contents.swift): Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. 

### Arrays
* [Plus One](CodePuzzles/PlusOne.playground/Contents.swift): Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.
* [Sum](CodePuzzles/Sum.playground/Contents.swift):  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
* [WordLadder](CodePuzzles/WordLadder.playground/Contents.swift):  Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord.
* [Roman Numbers](CodePuzzles/RomanIntegers.playground/Contents.swift): Given a integer convert to roman repreentation and vice versa. 
* [Missing Ranges](CodePuzzles/MissingRanges.playground/Contents.swift): Given a sorted integer array return its missing ranges.
* [Sudoku](CodePuzzles/Sudoku.playground.playground/Contents.swift): Check if given Sudoku is valid and find a solution. 

### Cryptography
* [Alphabet Cipher](CodePuzzles/AlphabetCipher.playground/Contentx.swift): Implement an Alphabet Cipher in Swift. 


## Swift Algorithms

* [Algorithm list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) A list of useful algorithms.

### Foundations

* [Big-O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) If you don't understand what does **O(n)** mean you should read this first.
* [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) Recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. Many problems have simple recursive solutions. 

### Trees
* [Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree](BasicAlgorithms/BinaryTree.playground/Contents.swift): A tree where each node has at most two children.
