# Swift Algorithms
Here you will find implementations of popular algorithms and data structures using Swift langauge, with detailed explanations of how and why they work. 

The goal ot this project is to explain how algorithms work. The focus is on clarity and simplicity of code. That said, most of the code should be ready for your project. Or use the code to prepare for you programming interview or computer science studies. 

Code ist compatible with **XCode 9.1 and Swift 4**.

## Basics

* [Big-O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) If you don't understand what does **O(n)** mean you should read this first.
* [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) Recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. Many problems have simple recursive solutions. 
* [Algorithm list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) A list of useful algorithms.

## The algorithms

### Trees
* [Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree](BinaryTree.playground/Contents.swift): A tree where each node has at most two children.
* [Longest Palindrom Substring](LongestPalindromSubstring.playground/Contents.swift): Two simple solutions to a simple but interesting problem.
* [Palindromr](Palindrome.playground/Contents.swift): Check if a given string is a palindrome.
* [Longest Palindrom Substring](LongestPalindromSubstring.playground/Contents.swift): Looks for longest palincromic stubstring.
* [Palindrome Number](PalindromNumber.playground/Contents.swift): Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. 
* [Plus One](PlusOne.playground/Contents.swift): Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.
* [Sum](Sum.playground/Contents.swift):  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
* [WordLadder](WordLadder.playground/Contents.swift):  Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord.
* [Roman Numbers](RomanIntegers.playground/Contents.swift): Given a integer convert to roman repreentation and vice versa. 
* [Missing Ranges](MissingRanges.playground/Contents.swift): Given a sorted integer array return its missing ranges.
