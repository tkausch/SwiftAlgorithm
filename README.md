# Swift Algorithms
Here you will find implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in Swift playgrounds, with detailed explanations of how and why they work. 

The goal ot this project is to explain how algorithms work. The focus is on clarity and simplicity of code. That said, most of the code should be ready for your project. Or use the code to prepare for you programming interview or computer science studies. 

Code ist compatible with **XCode 8.3 and Swift 3**.

## Basics

* [Big-O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) If you don't understand what does **O(n)** mean you should read this first.
* [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) Recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. Many problems have simple recursive solutions. 
* [Algorithm list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) A list of useful algorithms.

## The algorithms

### Trees
* [Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree](BinaryTree.playground/Contents.swift): A tree where each node has at most two children.
